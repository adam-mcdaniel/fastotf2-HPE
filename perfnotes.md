Here's what we're checking:
Read Events: counts, stores, and calculates stats on events, has potential to write to a file

For each program, we test it on a small trace and a large trace

## Python

Python versions use the Pyton otf2 module

### otf2readevents.py

Simplest implementation, in python
44 lines of code

#### Small trace
```console
❯ python3 otf2readevents.py
Time taken to open OTF2 archive: 0.01 seconds
Time taken to read and process events: 0.28 seconds
Total time: 0.28 seconds
Total execution time: 0.28 seconds
Event Summary:
Total number of events: 72670
Event types and their counts:
  Unknown: 72590 events
  Enter: 40 events
  Leave: 40 events
Total unique locations: 5
Total unique regions: 19
```
#### Large trace
```console
❯ python3 otf2readevents.py
Time taken to open OTF2 archive: 0.02 seconds
Time taken to read and process events: 42.18 seconds
Total time: 42.20 seconds
Total execution time: 42.20 seconds

Event Summary:
Total number of events: 16613424

  Unknown: 2633870 events
  Enter: 6989777 events
  Leave: 6989777 events

```

## C
C implementaions use the C API for OTF2

### otf2_read_events.c

C implementation needs me to create all the lookup tables and whatnot
380 lines of code

Correctness matches

#### Small trace:
```console
❯ gcc -o otf2_read_events otf2_read_events.c -I/opt/otf2/include -L/opt/otf2/lib -lotf2 -O3 && ./otf2_read_events
Time taken to open OTF2 archive: 0.00 seconds
Number of locations: 32

Time taken to read global definitions: 0.00 seconds
Time taken to read local definition files and mark all local event files for reading: 0.01 seconds
Time taken to read events: 0.02 seconds
Total time: 0.03 seconds
```

#### Large trace

```


### otf2_read_events_hash.c

Uses hashtables rather than arrays for definition context for O(1) lookups
456 Lines of code

#### Small trace
```console
❯ gcc -o otf2_read_events_hash otf2_read_events_hash.c -I/opt/otf2/include -L/opt/otf2/lib -lotf2 -O3 && ./otf2_read_events_hash

### otf2_read_events_parallel.chpl

A parallel version (using 8 readers in this case) of otf2_read_events.chpl.
There's more optimizations that can be done here, but this is a great proof of concept and correctness

### otf2_read_events_distributed.chpl

A distributed version of reading otf2 files.
Built chapel with CHPL_COMM=gasnet
I ran it using oversubscription on my mac, so performance numbers mean nothing.

However, the correctness still matches python/C so it means that we have a working
distributed OTF2 reader in Chapel!!
